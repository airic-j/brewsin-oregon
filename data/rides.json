The 108-mile Blue Mountain Century Scenic Bikeway is a breathtakingly beautiful loop that starts and ends in Heppner, a full-service community with secure places to leave your vehicle while you ride. The route is rich in history — Heppner was founded by Irish immigrants in 1887 — and initially follows the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway, rolling through valleys before climbing east through the Umatilla National Forest and then offering a thrill-ride descent to Highway 395, near Ukiah, where you can find overnight accommodations, a grocery store and a cafe. There the route turns north, transitioning from forest to rangeland before heading west along Highway 74 through more of Eastern Oregon’s rolling hills and back to Heppner. This route offers plenty of climbing — the top of the Umatilla Forest section is more than 3,000 feet above Heppner. But while the hills are long, they are not that steep. Take your time and enjoy the ride, because you’ll have plenty to look at.",

The route begins at the Village Green Park in the center of Sisters. The vast majority of the route is on Oregon Route 242 (selected to be on the U.S. Register of Historic Places, March 2011). Most of Oregon Route 242 is closed during winter months, but bicycles are usually allowed in the spring before it’s reopened to cars – providing miles of traffic-free road riding as the snow melts. McKenzie Pass is also a well-known secret among the riding community. Why? Because at certain times of the year you can ride this road when cars can’t drive it. The pass is only open during the summer/fall season, but It’s often navigable by bike long before It’s officially open. Check with the Blazin’ Saddles or Eurosport bike shops in Sisters for current access info, and check www.tripcheck.com for current road closures.",

It takes riders through an important agricultural area of the state, where grass seed, onion seed, carrot seed, garlic, potatoes, wheat, alfalfa, lavender and mint are grown. But best of all are the magnificent views for which the Madras Mountain Views Scenic Bikeway is named. Riders enjoy views of all seven major volcanic peaks in Oregon: Mount Jefferson, the county namesake; the Three Sisters mountains, Faith, Hope and Charity; Mount Hood; Broken Top; and Three-Fingered Jack; as well as several buttes. Riders cruise on a smooth, paved road with several gravel overlooks above The Cove Palisades State Park and Lake Billy Chinook. These overlooks are great places to see eagles, raptors, deer and even snakes or lizards.",

The hills get their name from the delicately colored stratifications in the soil of yellows, golds, blacks and reds, formed by shifting volcanic islands. A closer look reveals ancient plant and wood fossils. This Oregon Scenic Bikeway connects all three units of the John Day Fossil Beds, which hold the world’s best fossil record of the Age of Mammals (the last 50 million years) and exhibit a dramatic record of past climate change. The Bikeway features a hub-and-spoke design that offers a series of rides and loops, which easily connect for longer tours on largely low-traffic roads. The official map and cue sheet details several shorter segments, as well as the entire Scenic Bikeway. You can start and end your ride in any of the communities on the Bikeway; each has the amenities and supplies you need, plus a small town to explore. Beyond each town there are just the sounds of birds and the quiet. Water stops are limited to towns, except for the three Highway 19 parks between Fossil and Service Creek (see map), and the Painted Hills picnic area.",
